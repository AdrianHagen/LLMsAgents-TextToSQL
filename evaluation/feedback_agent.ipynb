This could imply that the database might be returning a JSON or array structure that needs parsing or handling. \\n\\\n",

      "                4. **No Need for GROUP BY or ORDER BY**: As the query focuses on a specific set identified by a unique code, there’s no need for additional clauses like GROUP BY or ORDER BY. \\n\\\n",
