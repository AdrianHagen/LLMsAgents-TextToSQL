479,False,moderate,True,"The query returns a sum of cards with unknown power, but it appears that the result is not correctly reflecting the count of such cards. The expression 'LIKE '*' OR T1.power IS NULL' may not be correctly filtering for unknown power, as 'LIKE' is typically used for pattern matching rather than checking for null values. It would be more appropriate to check specifically for NULL values or an empty string, depending on how unknown power is represented in the database."
1057,True,moderate,True,The query correctly calculates the average home team goals for the specified season and country. The use of SUM and COUNT is appropriate for calculating an average.
1367,True,simple,True,The query correctly identifies the college with the most members based on the aggregation and ordering applied. The use of GROUP BY and COUNT in conjunction with ORDER BY ensures that the correct college is returned as the one with the highest member count.
298,True,moderate,True,The query successfully calculates the percentage of molecules containing carcinogenic compounds where the element is hydrogen. The logic uses a CASE statement to count only those molecules that are labeled as carcinogenic and have hydrogen as an element.

1145,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the top 4 leagues with the most games in the 2015-2016 season. The use of COUNT and GROUP BY is appropriate for this analysis.
1165,False,moderate,True,"The query returned a value of 63, which suggests that the age gap was calculated correctly based on the provided criteria. However, the question specifically asks for the age gap between the youngest and oldest patients with a normal triglyceride level, while the query filters for patients with triglycerides greater than or equal to 200, which indicates high levels and not normal. The criteria used in the WHERE clause should reflect the condition for normal triglycerides instead."
494,False,challenging,True,"The query attempts to retrieve rulings for cards illustrated by Jim Pavelec, but it does not explicitly address whether these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. The generated SQL query's output does not provide any information about the properties and values of the cards themselves, only the text of the rulings. To fully answer the original question, the query should include additional checks or fields that indicate the properties and values of the cards along with the rulings."
1126,False,simple,False,LLM Failure
1292,False,challenging,True,"The query is incorrectly filtering patients based on uric acid levels. The original question asks for the female patient with the highest uric acid level within the normal range, which is typically considered to be 3.5 to 7.2 mg/dL for women. The query currently filters for uric acid levels greater than 6.5 mg/dL, which may exclude the highest normal value. Additionally, the query does not specify what 'normal range' means and assumes that any level above 6.5 is abnormal. Instead, the query should look for levels within the normal range and then identify the highest among those."
9,True,simple,True,"The query accurately counts the number of schools that are directly charter-funded among those with an average Math score over 560. The inner join between the SAT scores and the funding type is correctly implemented, and the conditions specified in the WHERE clause are appropriate for answering the original question."
152,False,moderate,True,"The query is not correctly answering the question. The original question asks for the average number of crimes committed specifically in 1995, but the query does not include a filter for the year 1995. Additionally, it does not specify that the regions should be those with crime numbers exceeding 4000, in relation to those accounts opened starting from 1997. The query should filter for the crime data from 1995 only."
1254,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly counts the number of patients with a normal Ig A level who came to the hospital after January 1, 1990. The filtering conditions applied in the SQL query align with the requirements of the original question."
609,False,simple,True,"The query is structured to count the number of posts with a score of 10, but the result indicates that the output is not just a simple count. The result tuple includes an additional value, which seems to be irrelevant to the original question. The query should only return the count as a single integer value."

489,False,simple,True,"The query returned a keyrune code, but the original question asked for the keyrune code for the set whose code is 'PKHC'. The code used in the query is 'PKHC', while the result shows the keyrune code associated with that set code, which is 'KHC'. If 'PKHC' does not exist in the database, the query should return an empty result, indicating that the set code is invalid or does not exist. Additionally, there may be a need to check if the keyrune code is properly defined for the set being queried."
1133,True,simple,True,The query correctly counts the number of football players named 'Aaron' born after the 1990s. The result of 9 matches the expected criteria.

54,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the school and its mailing zip code under Avetik Atoian's administration. The results match the original question.
53,False,simple,True,"The query is not correctly answering the original question. The result includes multiple tuples, each representing the number of test takers from different schools, but it does not provide a total count of test takers specifically for schools located in Fresno. Additionally, the original question asks for a single total number, whereas the query seems to return separate values for each school. The query should aggregate the results to provide a single total count."
34,True,moderate,True,The query accurately retrieves the free rate for students aged 5 to 17 at the school run by Kacey Gibson. The calculation appears to be correct as it divides the count of free meals by the enrollment figures.

1341,True,simple,True,The query accurately retrieves the location for the event 'Spring Budget Review'.
279,False,simple,True,"The query returned a result that does not align with the original question, which asks for the label of a specific bond ID. The query should ideally return the label as a single string or value, but instead, it returned a tuple with a structure that includes an extra element. It seems the query might be returning a calculation or aggregation instead of the label itself."

1102,False,moderate,True,"The query was intended to find the oldest player with a 77 overall rating on 2016-06-23. However, the query orders by birthday in ascending order, which would return the youngest player instead of the oldest. To find the oldest player, the order should be descending. Additionally, it would be useful to check if the birthday is being compared correctly to ensure the right player is selected."
847,True,simple,True,"The query accurately retrieves the surname of the driver with the best lap time in the specified race and qualifying period. The use of INNER JOIN to combine the qualifying and drivers tables is appropriate, and the ordering by lap time in qualifying period 2 is correctly applied."

1120,False,moderate,True,"The query returned a sum of 29 for the away team goals scored, which suggests it is calculating correctly. However, the original question specifically asks for the away team goals scored by both Daan Smith and Filipe Ferreira, but it seems to be aggregating results without ensuring that both players are included in the sum. The JOIN condition is also likely incorrect because it filters only by 'away_player_5'. It should consider all matches where either player scored goals."
1441,True,moderate,True,The query correctly counts the number of members with an education major in the specified college. The filtering criteria appear to be accurate based on the original question.

1405,False,moderate,True,"The query does not specifically filter for the 'April Speaker' event as it should. The event name needs to be correctly referenced to ensure that only the budget categories for this particular event are returned. Additionally, the output includes a second value, which may not be relevant to the original question."
883,False,simple,True,"The query returned a list of races from 2005, but it did not provide the total count of those races, which is also part of the original question. The original question asks for both the number of races and their names in descending order. The query needs to be revised to include a count of races while still returning their names."

347,False,moderate,True,"The query did not return results specifically related to cards illustrated by Stephen Daniele. It appears to have returned rulings for various cards and may not have filtered correctly for the artist's name or might include cards not illustrated by the specified artist. Additionally, there is no information on whether the cards have missing or degraded properties and values as requested in the original question."
1211,False,moderate,True,"The query filters for LDH values greater than 600 and less than 800, which does not match the original question that asks for LDH values between 100 and 300 above the normal range. Therefore, the query does not answer the question accurately. Additionally, the query should ensure that it retrieves patients who specifically fall within the correct LDH range rather than the specified values."

1124,False,moderate,False,LLM Failure
692,False,moderate,True,"The query result indicates a numerical value, which might represent the time taken, but it does not clarify the units (e.g., days, hours). Additionally, the structure of the result suggests that it may not be retrieving the correct information as it only shows a tuple with a single value. Ensure that the query correctly computes the difference between the badge acquisition date and the user account creation date, and consider including the actual date values for clarity."

442,False,simple,True,"The query returned results for sets in the specified blocks, but it appears to include multiple sets rather than a single set as implied by the wording of the original question. The original question suggests looking for one specific set, but the query retrieves distinct base set sizes and set codes for all sets in the blocks 'Masques' and 'Mirage'. This leads to a potentially confusing result as it does not specify which set should be mentioned."
427,False,moderate,True,"The query result includes languages but does not confirm that these languages are specifically available in the set known as Archenemy with code ARC. The filtering in the WHERE clause should ensure that the set being referenced is accurately identified by both name and code. It appears the condition on set code might not be correct, as the join and filtering could lead to misleading results."
1044,False,simple,True,"The query results include football players but they do not seem to be filtered correctly by birthyear and birthmonth. The check using SUBSTR on the 'birthday' field could lead to inaccuracies, particularly if the format of the 'birthday' string does not align with the expected format ('YYYY-MM-DD'). It’s recommended to use proper date functions or ensure the format is verified."

1357,False,simple,True,"The query returned two dates, which indicates multiple payments for dues made by Connor Hilton. However, the original question asks for a specific date, which implies a singular response. The query should be modified to return a single date or clarify if it should return all payment dates."
477,True,challenging,True,"The query correctly identifies the artists who have designed a card in the set Coldsnap, specifically Chippy and Jeremy Jarvis. However, the query does not include Aaron Miller in the results, which may indicate that either he has not designed a card in this set or there is an issue with the data. It would be beneficial to check if Aaron Miller should have cards listed in the Coldsnap set."
713,True,simple,True,The query successfully retrieves the up vote number for the specified comment text. No changes needed.
1458,False,moderate,True,"The query attempts to calculate the difference in membership counts between New Jersey and Vermont, but it does not accurately reflect the percentage of members in each state. Instead, it should calculate the percentage of total members for each state and then find the difference between those percentages. Additionally, the query's structure may lead to incorrect aggregation, as it uses COUNT(T1.member_id) for the denominator without ensuring it represents total members correctly."
784,False,simple,True,"The query returned only 'Liam' and 'Eric Brooks' as full names, but the question asks for all vampire heroes. There might be additional vampire heroes in the database that were not included in the results. Verify if there are more entries in the superhero table related to the vampire race."
342,False,simple,True,"The query only retrieves the name of the card with the lowest 'faceConvertedManaCost' due to the 'LIMIT 1' clause, rather than listing all card names that have a higher converted mana cost. Additionally, it does not filter based on any specific criteria to focus on cards with higher costs, which is what the original question asks for."
204,True,simple,True,The query correctly counts the number of carcinogenic molecules (indicated by T.label = '+') among the first 100 molecules (molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR099'). The count of 29 matches the expectation based on the question.
458,False,simple,True,"The query seems to attempt to count the number of cards that meet the criteria, but the SQL syntax used in the COUNT function is incorrect. The query should directly count the rows that match the conditions instead of using a CASE statement inside the COUNT. Additionally, the filtering for 'arena' and 'mtgo' should be handled to ensure that both types are present, rather than checking for the presence of a string. The query should also ensure it counts distinct artists if that’s the intention."
615,True,moderate,True,The query correctly calculates the percentage of users who are teenagers among those who obtained the 'Organizer' badges. The usage of IIF to count teenagers and dividing by the total count of users with the 'Organizer' badge is appropriate.

776,False,simple,True,"The query returned '3-D Man' with a race value of '-', which does not provide a valid race for Charles Chandler. The race field should reflect a legitimate race rather than a placeholder or empty value. It is possible that there is an issue with how the race is being retrieved or recorded in the database."
817,False,moderate,True,"The query returned multiple races for the blue-haired male superhero, including an unspecified race represented by '-'. The original question asks for a specific race, suggesting that the query should return a single race. Additionally, if there are multiple superheroes fitting the criteria, it might be useful to clarify how to handle that (e.g., returning one or all). Consider using DISTINCT or aggregating the results to provide a clearer answer."
353,False,simple,True,"The query results include all sets, but it is unclear if they are specifically available in Italian translation. The query should include a condition to ensure that only sets with Italian translations are returned. Additionally, check if the translation exists for each set."

1501,False,moderate,True,"The query did not correctly filter transactions for June 2013. The WHERE clause using 'T3.Date = '201306'' seems to be incorrect if 'Date' is not stored in the 'YYYYMM' format. Additionally, it lacks a check to ensure there are actual transactions within that month. The returned results do not confirm whether there were transactions during that specific month."
159,False,simple,True,"The query is expected to return the withdrawals in cash transactions specifically made by the client with the ID 3356. However, the results returned do not confirm that they are cash transactions.

192,False,moderate,True,"The query does not accurately answer the original question. The original question asks for the average amount of loans that are still under running contracts with statement issuance after each transaction. However, the query filters the loan status to 'C' and 'D', which may not correlate with running contracts. Additionally, there is no indication in the query that it accounts for the statement issuance after each transaction, which may be a crucial condition. The filtering criteria should be reconsidered to ensure that it reflects currently active loans."

31,False,moderate,True,"The query aims to find the eligible free rate for the 10th and 11th schools based on enrollment. However, the results include the 9th and 10th schools due to the LIMIT clause starting from 9. Additionally, the query does not filter for students in grades 1 through 12, which is crucial according to the original question. Consider adding a WHERE clause to filter schools by the appropriate grade levels."
512,True,simple,True,The query accurately counts the number of cards with an unknown power that cannot be found in foil for duel deck A. The conditions applied in the query correctly filter for cards with a power of '*' or NULL and also check for the absence of foil. The result aligns with the original question's requirements.
202,False,simple,True,The query is attempting to count the number of triple type bonds but seems to be using an incorrect filter for the bond_type. The filter value '#' is not a valid representation of triple bonds in most databases. You should check the actual values that represent triple bonds in the bond_type field.
