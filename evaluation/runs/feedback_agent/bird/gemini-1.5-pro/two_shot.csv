1211,False,moderate,True,"The query is almost correct, however, the question asks for the age which should be calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year. Additionally, it needs to consider the normal range and calculate the index based on that. Assuming the normal range for LDH is 120-250, the index can be calculated as (LDH - 250) * 100 / (250-120)."

The current query returns all female patients above 50 regardless of their red blood cell count. You could update the query to include other relevant factors if available.

Lastly, let's make it clear we're returning the patient's ID and whether or not they were admitted."
