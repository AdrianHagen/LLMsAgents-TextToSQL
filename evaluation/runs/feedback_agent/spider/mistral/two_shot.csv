477,True,True,The query correctly retrieves both the detention start time (datetime_detention_start) and end time (datetime_detention_end) from the Detention table. The results show pairs of timestamps representing when each detention began and ended. The data appears to be properly formatted and includes records spanning multiple years. No modifications are needed as the query directly answers the original question.
259,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1. The product_price column is not included in the output, making it impossible to verify the ascending order. 2. The string literal 'Hardware' should be in single quotes. 3. The result doesn't show the prices, so we can't verify if the ordering is correct."
1708,True,True,"The query correctly sums the values of boxes from warehouses located in Chicago or New York. It properly joins the boxes table with the warehouses table using the warehouse code and filters for the specified locations.

The result shows a complete list of agencies with their IDs and names, which directly answers the original question. The query is simple and efficient, selecting exactly the required fields."
1362,False,True,"The query partially answers the question but has two issues: 1) The LIKE operator syntax is incorrect (using straight quotes instead of single/double quotes), and 2) The pattern matching should be case-insensitive to catch all possible variations of 'ish'."
1751,False,True,"The query has the correct concept but incorrect column ordering. The 'warehouse' column should be first in the SELECT statement for better readability, and the column names should be more descriptive using aliases. Currently, the results show count first and warehouse second, which might be confusing."
1015,True,True,"The query correctly identifies the author with the most citations and returns both their name and citation count. The query joins the Citation table with Author_list and Author tables appropriately to track citations per author, groups by author_id to aggregate citations, orders in descending order to get the highest count, and limits to 1 to get only the top result. The result shows that Franz Josef Och has the highest number of citations with 3,650 citations."
905,True,True,"The query correctly counts the total number of boats in the Boats table using COUNT(*). The result shows there are 3 boats in total, which directly answers the original question. The execution time was approximately 0.0002 seconds."
569,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) While it attempts to find the book with the highest purchase price, the price itself is not displayed in the results, making it impossible to verify if this is indeed the highest price. 2) The query should handle cases where multiple books share the same highest price. 3) The extremely small purchase price (0.0005607919883914292) suggests there might be data quality issues or unit conversion problems in the database."
536,True,True,The query correctly answers the question by providing a list of ISBNs and their corresponding order counts. The query uses GROUP BY to aggregate the orders by ISBN and COUNT(*) to count the number of orders for each book. The results show 5 different books with their ISBNs and the number of times each has been ordered (ranging from 1 to 4 orders per book).
2142,False,True,The query has several issues: 1. It's not correctly checking for meeting attendance as it doesn't join with the meetings table. 2. The GROUP BY clause with COUNT(*) isn't actually counting meetings. 3. The LIKE condition is working but should be case-insensitive for better results.
2124,True,True,"The query correctly answers the question by providing a count of meetings for each meeting outcome. The results show that there were 4 meetings with 'Report' outcome, 6 meetings with 'Summary' outcome, and 5 meetings with 'Vote results' outcome. The query uses appropriate GROUP BY clause to aggregate the counts by meeting_outcome."
1801,True,True,"The query correctly identifies states that have more than two universities with enrollment less than 3000. It uses appropriate GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to filter the results based on the count of universities per state. The query returns Wisconsin as the only state meeting these criteria, which appears to be accurate given the data."
1379,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves the names of official languages and counts how many countries use each language. It properly joins the official_languages table with the languages table and groups the results by language name. The results show, for example, that English is an official language in 3 countries, while most other languages are official in 1 country each. The query uses appropriate GROUP BY and COUNT aggregation to provide the requested information."
342,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It's not grouping the buildings by their number of stories, which is needed to show how many buildings have each number of stories. 2) The result should include a count of buildings for each story count. 3) The current result only shows a single value (24) without context of how many buildings have that many stories."
76,False,True,"The query correctly joins the necessary tables and groups by order_id, but there are two issues: 1) It's using sum(product_price) which might double-count if there are multiple items of the same product in an order. We should multiply product_price by quantity. 2) The query should consider the quantity of items ordered for accurate total cost calculation."
453,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It only returns the student_details and address type, but the question asks for 'personal details' which should include more comprehensive information about students (like name, contact info, etc.). 2) The student_details column seems to only contain addresses, which is not the complete personal information. 3) The query should select specific columns that constitute personal details rather than using a generic student_details field."
135,False,True,"There are several issues with the current query: 1. The result contains duplicate entries for the same channels. 2. The query returns channels not directed by Hank Baskett, but might miss channels that have no directors at all. 3. The result format is showing some timing information that shouldn't be included. We should use DISTINCT to remove duplicates and LEFT JOIN to include all channels."
1873,False,True,"The query returns the package numbers but doesn't count them as requested in the original question. The question specifically asks to count the number of packages, but the current query just lists the package numbers. We should use COUNT() to get the total number of packages meeting these criteria."
896,True,True,"The query correctly answers the question. It shows the count of reservations for each boat (bid) that has an ID greater than 50. The results show that boat 102 has 2 reservations and boat 103 has 2 reservations.

962,False,True,"The query has two main issues: 1) It's not properly filtering for headphones in stock, as it's excluding all stores that have any stock at all, not specifically headphones. 2) The JOIN condition should also consider the inventory count to ensure there are truly no headphones available."
1609,False,True,"The query only returns the driver names without displaying their ages. To properly verify if the drivers are listed in ascending order of age, the Age column should be included in the result set. Additionally, it's good practice to explicitly handle NULL values in the ordering."
1743,True,True,"The query correctly counts the number of boxes in each warehouse. The results show that:
- Warehouse 1 has 4 boxes
- Warehouses 2, 3, and 4 each have 2 boxes
- Warehouse 5 has 1 box
The GROUP BY clause appropriately groups the results by warehouse, and COUNT(*) gives us the number of boxes in each warehouse."
1235,True,True,The query correctly retrieves the locations and mediums of paintings created by artists with the first name 'Pablo'. It joins the artists and paintings tables appropriately and filters for the first name 'Pablo'. The results show three paintings: two oil paintings in the Rice Building Special Exhibition Galleries and one lithograph with no specified location.
39,False,True,"The query returns only the earnings without identifying which earnings belong to which country. It would be more informative to include the player names and their corresponding countries alongside their earnings to provide complete context. Additionally, the result should be ordered for better readability."
251,True,True,"The query correctly identifies hardware products with prices above the average price for hardware products. It uses a subquery to calculate the average price of hardware products and compares each hardware product's price against this average. The result shows 'Mouse' as the only product meeting these criteria, which is a valid outcome."
1793,True,True,The query correctly retrieves university names ordered by their reputation points. It properly joins the University and Overall_ranking tables using university_id and orders the results based on reputation_point. The results show a list of universities which appears to be sorted as requested.
1082,True,True,"The query correctly identifies conferences with Canadian staff members by joining the conference, conference_participation, and staff tables. It properly filters for Canadian nationality and returns conference names. The result shows 'ACL' as a conference with Canadian staff members. The joins and filtering conditions are appropriate for the question asked."
987,False,True,"The query returned no results, which is unexpected given that both Kathleen McKeown and Owen Rambow are well-known researchers with multiple publications. The issue likely stems from the LIKE pattern matching in the WHERE clause. The format of names in the database might be different from what we're assuming, and the spaces around the commas in the patterns might be causing issues. Additionally, the order of the names might be reversed in the database (e.g., 'Kathleen McKeown' instead of 'McKeown, Kathleen')."
661,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves all collection subset names from the Collection_Subsets table. The result shows a list of all distinct collection subset names, which directly answers the original question.

1414,True,True,"The query correctly calculates the average room count for properties that have gardens. It properly joins the Property_Features, Features, and Properties tables to filter properties with gardens and then calculates the average room count. The result shows that properties with gardens have an average of 7.25 rooms."
1339,True,True,The query correctly retrieves race names where drivers aged 26 or older participated. It performs an appropriate join between the driver and race tables and applies the correct age filter. The result shows two specific races that meet this criteria. The query structure is sound and produces the expected results by linking drivers to their races and filtering based on the age requirement.
264,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) The average prices seem unreasonably high (in millions), suggesting possible data quality issues or incorrect calculation. 2) The output shows product_type_code but the question asks for product type (name). 3) The result format includes an unexpected timing metric. 4) The GROUP BY should join with product_types table to show meaningful type names instead of codes."
1936,True,True,"The query correctly calculates the average number of units sold in millions for games not developed by Nintendo. The filtering condition 'developers != 'Nintendo'' properly excludes Nintendo-developed games, and the avg() function appropriately calculates the mean units sold. The result shows approximately 20.065 million units as the average."
953,False,True,"The query assumes that stores without any stock entries have no headphones, but this might not be accurate. We should specifically check for headphone stock being 0 or NULL. Additionally, the current query will exclude stores that have any stock items, not just headphones."
1530,False,True,"The query has two issues: 1. It compares with the maximum price of Tarts, which means it will return items cheaper than the most expensive Tart. The question asks for items cheaper than 'any' Tart, which means it should compare with the minimum price of Tarts. 2. The SQL syntax is incorrect as the string literal 'Tart' should be enclosed in single quotes, not double quotes."
682,True,True,The query correctly identifies document IDs that are not parent documents by using the EXCEPT operator to find Document_Object_IDs that don't appear as Parent_Document_Object_IDs. The result shows document ID 8 is not a parent document.

609,False,True,The query has several issues: 1. The JOIN with review table will duplicate books if they have multiple reviews. 2. We need to aggregate the number of readers per book to get the correct ordering. 3. The SELECT should be based on a subquery or GROUP BY to get unique books with their total readers.
1255,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It uses 'mediumOn' which appears to be incorrect syntax - it should likely be 'medium' or similar. 2) The comparison with 'canvas' should use single quotes in SQL. 3) The logic is using MIN height which will return paintings taller than the shortest canvas painting, which might not accurately represent the question's intent of comparing against 'some' painting on canvas (ANY would be more appropriate)."
1845,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves theater names showing G-rated movies by joining the movies table with movietheaters table on the movie code and filtering for G-rated movies. The result shows 'Paraiso' as a theater showing G-rated movies, which directly answers the original question."

1785,True,True,"The query correctly identifies universities that don't have any major ranked as 1. It uses EXCEPT to find universities that exist in the University table but are not present in the Major_Ranking table with rank 1. The approach is efficient and accurate, using a proper JOIN between Major_Ranking and University tables to exclude universities with rank 1 majors."
1132,False,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It's returning duplicate names which suggests we might need DISTINCT. 2) The query is selecting from 'pilotskills' table which might not be the correct table for pilot demographics - we should use the pilots table for basic pilot information. 3) While it includes the ORDER BY clause, we're only selecting the names without the age, making it impossible to verify if the ordering is correct."
2109,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves all payment records with their payment IDs, corresponding invoice IDs, and payment details (payment method/card type). The results show a complete list of payments with all requested information. The query structure is simple and efficient, selecting all relevant columns from the Payments table."
1523,False,True,"The query has two issues: 1) The string literal 'Apricot' should be using single quotes in SQL. 2) The query assumes exact match for flavor, but should probably use LIKE or ILIKE with wildcards to catch variations of 'Apricot' in flavor descriptions. The current query happens to work but isn't following SQL best practices."
893,False,True,"While the query does count reservations per boat, it has several issues: 1) It only shows boats that have reservations, excluding boats with zero reservations. 2) The column names are not descriptive. 3) There's no ordering to make the results more readable."
1615,True,True,"The query correctly identifies the maximum points earned by drivers from countries with capital 'Dublin' (which would be Ireland). It properly joins the country and driver tables, filters for Dublin as the capital, and calculates the maximum points. The query structure and logic are sound."
1060,True,True,"The query correctly counts the occurrences of each conference name by using COUNT(*) and GROUP BY. The results show that each conference (ACL, AICS, and Naccl) has occurred 2 times. The query structure and results directly answer the original question by providing the frequency count for each conference name."

The result shows a complete list of clients with their corresponding addresses, which directly answers the original question."
1717,True,True,"The query correctly finds warehouse locations that store both Rocks and Scissors by using an INTERSECT operation between two subqueries. Each subquery joins the boxes and warehouses tables to get locations for a specific content type, and the INTERSECT ensures we get only locations that appear in both result sets. The execution time (9.87e-05 seconds) is reasonable, and the results show two warehouses (Chicago and Los Angeles) that meet the criteria."
1952,True,True,"The query correctly identifies the developers of games played by Auburn college students. It properly joins the game, game_player, and player tables to establish the relationship between games and players, and then filters for Auburn college students. Note that the results show two slightly different spellings of the same developer ('Nintendo / GameFreak' and 'Nintendo/GameFreak'), which might be worth standardizing in the database for consistency, but this is a data quality issue rather than a query problem."
1218,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves the distinct birth years of artists who made sculptures after 1920. The query joins the artists and sculptures tables appropriately using artistID and sculptorID, and properly filters for sculptures made after 1920. The DISTINCT keyword ensures no duplicate birth years are returned. The result shows at least one artist was born in 1881 who made sculptures after 1920."
583,True,True,"The query correctly counts the number of orders for 'Pride and Prejudice' by joining the Book table with the Books_Order table on the isbn field and filtering for the specific title. The result shows there are 4 orders for this book, which directly answers the original question."
48,True,True,"The query correctly identifies products that have not been ordered at least twice. It uses EXCEPT to find the difference between all products and products that have been ordered 2 or more times. The result shows one product (Dell keyboard) that hasn't met the ordering threshold. The query includes all requested fields (id, name, price, and color) and uses appropriate joins between Products, Order_items, and Orders tables."
1983,True,True,The query correctly counts the number of authors who are under 30 years old. The query uses the appropriate COUNT(*) function and filters with the correct condition 'age < 30'. The result shows that there are 3 authors under the age of 30 in the database.

The current result shows that driver_id 4 has driven 2 vehicles, but the presentation could be clearer."
1673,False,True,The query has multiple issues: 1. It's joining the championship table unnecessarily when we only need institution data. 2. This join might be filtering out institutions that haven't won championships. 3. We should be selecting directly from the institution table since we're looking for all institutions' nicknames ordered by capacity.
2146,True,True,"The query correctly retrieves all required information about meetings including start times, end times, client details, and staff details. The joins between meetings, clients, and staff tables are properly constructed to show the relationship between meetings and their attendees.
