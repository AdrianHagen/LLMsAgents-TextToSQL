2. The query needs to ensure that it accurately checks for players who remain in their position while the team attacked. This would require adding a condition to check the attacking work rate.
3. The original question is about counting players born before 1986, so the count should not be DISTINCT unless there are duplicates in player names, which should be confirmed.

2. **Check for Division by Zero**: The current query may lead to division by zero if there are no students in the physics major. You should include a safeguard for this scenario, potentially using a NULLIF function to avoid errors.
3. **Aggregation Context**: The query structure is appropriate for calculating a ratio, but ensure that the context of the majors used is correct and relevant.
4. **Null Handling**: The query result shows that it returns null, indicating that either there are no majors matching the criteria or the division resulted in an invalid operation due to zero in the denominator. Ensure that the data exists and handle such cases appropriately.

2. The filtering condition for TG levels is set correctly at 'T2.TG >= 200', but the definition of normal TG levels should be confirmed as it may vary. This threshold could be adjusted based on medical guidelines.
3. The age calculation is incorrect. The current calculation is using STRFTIME incorrectly, and it doesn't seem to calculate the age properly. Instead, the age should be calculated from the birthday directly against the current date.

1. The COUNT function is being used incorrectly. Instead of counting a CASE expression, you should count the distinct artists (or relevant identifier) directly.
2. The filtering condition for availability should be modified. Using LIKE with '%arena,mtgo%' may not accurately reflect that both conditions must be satisfied. Instead, consider using a filtering method that checks for both 'arena' and 'mtgo' separately, possibly using the AND operator.
3. The query lacks a GROUP BY clause if you need to count distinct artists based on your conditions. You should select the artist's unique identifier and group by it before counting.
4. If you want to ensure that the artist has at least one card available in both printing types, you might need to use a HAVING clause instead of a WHERE clause after grouping.

2. **Calculating Percentage**: The logic used to calculate the percentage of incredibly powerful cards seems incorrect. The CASE statement does not seem to evaluate whether a card is incredibly powerful.

1247,True,challenging,True,"The query has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly answer the original question. Here is a step-by-step suggestion on how the query should be improved:
1. **Condition Logic**: The query uses an 'OR' condition for fibrinogen levels (FG) which is not appropriate. The question specifies an 'abnormal' fibrinogen level, so we should be looking for patients with FG < 190 or FG > 381. The current logic correctly captures this, but it should be explicitly stated that we are counting those who meet this condition.
2. **Normal WBC Levels**: The query is filtering for patients with WBC levels that are considered normal (between 3.546 and 9.378). In the context of the question, you need to ensure that these patients are excluded when counting those with abnormal fibrinogen levels. Thus, you need to ensure that you are counting those with abnormal fibrinogen levels only.
3. **Query Structure**: The logical operator precedence in SQL requires the use of parentheses to ensure that the conditions are applied correctly. You should group conditions involving FG separately from the WBC conditions.
4. **Final Count**: Ensure that the counting logic is applied correctly to only those patients who meet all the specified criteria. 

An updated query would be:

2. Instead of using multiple OR conditions, it would be more efficient to use the IN clause for artist selection. This will simplify the query and ensure all specified artists are considered.
3. The GROUP BY clause is unnecessary here since we are only interested in whether the specified artists have designed cards, not in aggregating results.

However, the current query only considers loans with statuses 'C' (Closed) and 'D' (Default), which may not represent loans that are still active or running.
2. The filtering condition should focus on loans that are currently 'active' or 'running,' which might be represented by a different status (not closed or defaulted). You should check the loan status column for appropriate values that indicate an active loan.
3. The frequency condition in the WHERE clause should also be reviewed. It currently filters for 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', but it's unclear if this is relevant for loans that are 'running' and have statement issuance after each transaction. Ensure that this condition aligns with the original question criteria.
4. Lastly, if the question is about averaging over loans with statement issuance after transactions, you might need to include a condition or join that relates to the transaction dates and statement issuance, which is currently missing from the query.

1. **Correct Filtering**: The second subquery filters for 'falcon', which does not correspond to the original question. It should filter for 'Charles Chandler' instead. 
2. **Handling of NULL values**: The result is null, which indicates that at least one of the weights could not be found. It's important to ensure that both Emil Blonsky and Charles Chandler exist in the superhero table and that their weights are not null. 
3. **Using JOIN instead of Subqueries**: Instead of using two subqueries, a more efficient approach would be to use a JOIN, which can directly compute the difference between the two weights in a single query. 
4. **Handling Exceptions**: Consider adding a case to handle situations where either of the weights is NULL to avoid unexpected results.
