It joins the Country and Match tables appropriately, filters for Poland and the specific season, and performs the average calculation using SUM/COUNT. The result appears reasonable for average goals per match."
1367,False,simple,True,"The query has two main issues: 1) It's grouping by major_id but selecting college, which could lead to incorrect aggregation. 2) The grouping should be by college since we want to find which college has the most members. The current query might not give the correct count because it's grouping by major_id instead of college."
298,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules containing hydrogen. It uses: 1) A CASE statement to count molecules where element is 'h' AND the molecule is carcinogenic (label = '+'), 2) Divides by total number of molecules and multiplies by 100 to get percentage, 3) Uses CAST AS REAL to ensure decimal division. The result shows approximately 17.22% of carcinogenic molecules contain hydrogen."
651,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the related post title by joining the postLinks table with the posts table twice - once for the original post and once for the related post. The WHERE clause correctly filters for the specific post title we're looking for, and returns the title of the related post.

1145,True,simple,True,"The query correctly identifies the top 4 leagues with the most games in the 2015/2016 season. It properly joins the League and Match tables, filters for the correct season, groups by league name, and orders by the count of matches in descending order. The LIMIT 4 ensures we get only the top 4 leagues. While the count of games isn't shown in the results, the ordering is correct based on the COUNT(t2.id) in the query."
1165,False,moderate,True,"The query has two main issues: 1) It's looking for triglycerides >= 200, which represents abnormal levels (normal TG levels are typically < 150 mg/dL). 2) The age calculation using STRFTIME might not be as accurate as it only considers years, not months and days. Also, we want normal triglyceride levels, not elevated ones."
494,True,challenging,True,"The query effectively retrieves the rulings text for cards illustrated by Jim Pavelec and includes a check for content warnings (hasContentWarning flag). The query joins the cards and rulings tables correctly using the uuid field, and provides both the ruling text and an indication of whether the card has any content warnings ('YES'/'NO'). The results show detailed rulings about game mechanics, indicating that the cards' properties and values are well-documented and complete. Based on the results, none of the cards appear to have missing or degraded properties."
1126,False,simple,True,"The current query has several issues: 1) It only looks at home_player_1, missing other player positions and away team players. 2) It joins through Match table which might introduce duplicates and isn't necessary to find players from Belgium. 3) A player's nationality should be directly linked to the player table, not derived from matches they played in Belgian leagues."
1292,False,challenging,True,"The query has several issues: 1. It's filtering for uric acid > 6.5, which appears to be looking for values above normal range, not within normal range. 2. The normal range for uric acid should be explicitly defined (typically 2.4-6.0 mg/dL for females). 3. The query should include a BETWEEN clause to capture values within the normal range."

The JOIN operation between the superhero and race tables is properly implemented, and the WHERE clause correctly filters for the specific superhero ID. The result provides both requested pieces of information."
1102,False,moderate,True,"The query is incorrect because it orders by birthday ASC (ascending), which will give us the youngest player instead of the oldest. To get the oldest player, we should order by birthday DESC (descending). The rest of the query logic is correct in terms of joining the tables and filtering for the specific date and overall rating."
847,True,simple,True,"The query correctly answers the original question by: 1) Joining the qualifying and drivers tables to get driver information, 2) Filtering for race ID 19, 3) Ordering by Q2 time in ascending order (fastest first), and 4) Limiting to 1 result to get the best time. The query returns Fisichella as the driver with the fastest Q2 time in race 19."
1300,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly identifies the disease diagnosis (SLE) for the patient with the highest triglyceride level while still being within the normal range (< 200). The query joins the Examination and Laboratory tables appropriately, filters for normal triglyceride levels (TG < 200), orders by TG in descending order, and takes the top result. This matches the requirements of the original question."
1120,False,moderate,True,"The current query has several issues: 1) It only checks for goals where these players were in position 'away_player_5', but they could have played in other positions. 2) We should check all player positions (away_player_1 through away_player_11) to get the complete goal count. 3) The query structure assumes the player scored all away team goals when they were playing, which is incorrect as it counts the entire team's goals when these players were in the lineup."
1441,False,moderate,True,The query has a few issues: 1. The position filter 'Member' is unnecessary as we want to count all members regardless of their position. 2. The LIKE '%Education%' might be too restrictive as there could be education-related majors that don't contain the word 'Education'. We should rely on the college filter alone since we want all majors within the College of Education & Human Services.
920,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves all distinct years where races were held at Silverstone Circuit. It properly joins the circuits and races tables and filters for Silverstone Circuit specifically. The results show a comprehensive list of years from 1950 to 2017, which aligns with the historical usage of the circuit in Formula 1.

789,True,simple,True,The query correctly calculates the average weight of alien heroes. It joins the superhero table with the race table to filter for aliens and then calculates the average weight using SUM/COUNT. The CAST AS REAL ensures decimal precision in the calculation. The result appears reasonable for superhero weights in kilograms.
347,False,moderate,True,"There are several issues with the current query: 1. The artist name in the WHERE clause is 'Stephen Daniele' but the question asks for 'Stephen Daniel' - this is a spelling mismatch. 2. The query doesn't clearly indicate which cards these rulings belong to, making it difficult to identify the actual cards illustrated by the artist. 3. To properly answer the question about missing or degraded properties, we should include more card details in the selection. 4. The current results seem to be showing rulings for cards that might not be related to the specified artist."
1211,False,moderate,True,"There are multiple issues with the query: 1) The calculation of age using STRFTIME is not reliable as it only considers the year, not months and days. 2) The LDH range in the query (600-800) doesn't match the requirement of '100-300 index above normal range'. Assuming the normal range upper limit is 500, the query should look for values between 600-800. 3) It would be better to use DATEDIFF or a more precise age calculation method."
1115,True,challenging,True,"The query correctly calculates the percentage difference between Landon Donovan's and Jordan Bowery's overall ratings on July 12, 2013. The query performs the following operations correctly: 1) Joins Player and Player_Attributes tables, 2) Filters for the specific date, 3) Identifies the two players, 4) Calculates the percentage difference using the formula: ((Donovan - Bowery) / Donovan) * 100. The result shows that Donovan's rating was approximately 25.32% higher than Bowery's on that date."
1045,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the attacking work rate for Franco Zennaro by joining the Player and Player_Attributes tables and filtering for the specific player. The result shows that Franco Zennaro has a 'medium' attacking work rate, which directly answers the original question."
227,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1. The table alias 'T' is referenced in the CASE statement but the table is aliased as 't' (case mismatch). 2. The table name is 'molecule' but we're querying for carcinogenic labels which might be in a different table. 3. Without seeing the database schema, this appears to be looking for a 'label' column directly in the molecule table which might not be correct."
1379,True,simple,True,The query is correctly structured and provides the accurate count of meeting events for 2020. It properly filters for event type 'Meeting' and uses SUBSTR to extract the year from the event_date field. The result shows that 9 meeting events were held in 2020.
717,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves all superpowers associated with 3-D Man through proper table joins. It joins the superhero table with hero_power junction table and then with superpower table to get the power names. The result shows four distinct powers: Agility, Super Strength, Stamina, and Super Speed. The query structure and logic are sound."
1495,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It doesn't explicitly show the consumption amount, making it difficult to verify if this is truly the highest consumer. 2) The table join appears correct but we should also show the consumption value for transparency. 3) The query could be clearer by including the consumption amount in the SELECT clause."
1131,False,simple,True,The query has several issues: 1) It's joining Player with Match table using the same ID which is incorrect as these would be different IDs. 2) The Match table isn't necessary for this query since we only need to know which players are from Italy. 3) The Player table should directly link to Country through a country_id or similar field. The current join path could potentially duplicate players and affect the average calculation.
1124,False,moderate,False,LLM Failure
692,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It doesn't specify which badge we're looking for, as a user might have multiple badges. 2) The date difference calculation doesn't specify the unit (days, months, years). 3) The result format (1,) is not meaningful without proper context. The query should use DATEDIFF or a similar function to get a clear time measurement."
1459,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves both the major name and its corresponding department for Garrett Gerke. The JOIN operation between the member and major tables is properly constructed, and the WHERE clause correctly filters for the specific student. The result shows that Garrett Gerke's major is 'Human Development and Family Studies' in the 'Human Development and Family Studies Department'."
452,False,simple,True,"The query looks for cards where isTextless = 0, which assumes that 0 means the card has text. However, this might be incorrect as the column name 'isTextless' suggests that a value of 1 would mean the card is textless, and 0 would mean it has text. To be more explicit and avoid potential confusion, we should check if the card has a non-empty text box."
916,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the surnames of all Italian drivers from the drivers table by filtering on nationality = 'Italian'. The results show a list of Italian surnames as requested, including well-known Italian F1 drivers like Trulli, Fisichella, and Giovinazzi.

The joins are properly established using the appropriate foreign keys (event_id, budget_id) and the filtering is done correctly on the event_name. The result shows the sum of all costs associated with the Yearly Kickoff event."
938,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It's not correctly identifying the champion/winner of the race. The query is trying to use 'time' to determine the winner, which is not reliable. We should use 'position=1' or 'positionOrder=1' to identify the race winner. 2) The joins are correct in connecting drivers, results, and races tables, but the filtering condition needs to be adjusted to properly identify the winner."
1357,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the dates when Connor Hilton paid dues. It properly joins the member and income tables, filters by the member's first and last name, and specifically looks for 'Dues' as the source of income.

The result shows that there is approximately 12.12% more membership from New Jersey compared to Vermont."
784,True,simple,True,"The query correctly identifies vampire heroes by joining the superhero table with the race table and filtering for vampires. The results show Liam and Eric Brooks (who is known as Blade), which are both vampire characters. The query properly uses an INNER JOIN to connect the tables using race_id and filters specifically for the Vampire race."
342,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It only returns one card (LIMIT 1) when the question asks to 'list' cards implying multiple results. 2) The question mentions 'value' but this isn't considered in the query. 3) The ORDER BY is ascending by default, but we want cards with MORE converted mana cost. 4) The comparison between value and mana cost isn't being made at all."
204,True,simple,True,The query correctly counts the number of carcinogenic molecules (indicated by label = '+') within the first 100 molecules. The query uses the appropriate BETWEEN clause to limit the range and correctly joins with the label condition. The result shows that 29 molecules out of the first 100 are carcinogenic.
458,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) Using LIKE with '%arena,mtgo%' is not reliable as it might catch other combinations and wrong ordering of these values. 2) The availability field should be checked for both values independently. 3) The artist count might be inflated as we're not using DISTINCT artists. 4) The CASE statement is unnecessary for this query."
615,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1) The result should be a percentage (multiplied by 100), but the query formatting makes it unclear whether that's happening correctly. 2) The age calculation logic is correct (between 13 and 18 for teenagers), but the IIF function might not be standard SQL - CASE WHEN would be more widely supported. 3) The query doesn't properly format the percentage for readability. 4) The backticks around 'Name' might cause issues in some SQL dialects."
295,False,simple,True,"The query has multiple issues: 1) It's filtering for molecules where label = '+' which doesn't specifically indicate carcinogenic compounds, 2) The label condition should likely reference a specific carcinogenic label from the database, 3) The case sensitivity of 'h' vs 'H' for hydrogen should be verified, 4) The query should be checking for carcinogenic compounds in a more specific way."
414,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) The query returns all languages for sets in the Ravnica block with 180 cards, but doesn't specify which set specifically. 2) There could be multiple sets in the Ravnica block with 180 cards, making the results ambiguous. 3) We should identify the specific set first and then find its translations. 4) The baseSetSize filter might be too restrictive if we're not certain about the exact number."
1236,True,challenging,True,"The query correctly addresses all requirements of the question:
1. Filters female patients (T1.SEX = 'F')
2. Checks for age 50 and above using the Birthday field

4. Shows admission status with '+' for admitted and '-' for not admitted
5. Uses DISTINCT to avoid duplicates
The results show patient IDs and their admission status as requested."
935,False,simple,True,"The query is not accurately counting the finished drivers. Using T2.time IS NOT NULL is incorrect because not all finished races have a time recorded (some might have status like 'Finished' but no time). Instead, we should check the status to determine if a driver finished the race. In F1, drivers can finish a race even if they're lapped or have other conditions."
776,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the hero name and race for Charles Chandler. The result shows his superhero name is '3-D Man' and his race is marked as '-'. The query properly joins the superhero and race tables and filters by the full name. The structure of the query is correct and provides the requested information.
817,False,moderate,True,"The query returns multiple races for blue-haired male superheroes, which makes it ambiguous to answer the original question that seems to be asking about a specific superhero. The result shows three different races (Mutant, -, and Strontian). To make the query more specific, we might need additional filtering criteria to identify the specific blue-haired male superhero in question. Consider adding the superhero's name or other unique identifiers if available."

435,False,simple,True,The query has several issues: 1. The GROUP BY clause is unnecessary since we're not performing any aggregation. 2. The query doesn't provide a count of cards as requested in the question. 3. We should use COUNT() to get the total number of black-bordered cards along with listing the IDs.
892,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly returns the driver with the most points by joining the necessary tables (races, driverStandings, and drivers) and ordering by points in descending order. It provides the full name (Sebastian Vettel) along with their highest points (397.0). The LIMIT 1 ensures we get only the top scorer."
748,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the eye color of the superhero with ID 75. It properly joins the superhero table with the colour table using the eye_colour_id as the joining key. The result shows that the superhero has blue eyes.
192,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly calculates the average loan amount for running contracts with statement issuance after each transaction.

512,False,simple,True,"The query has a few issues: 1) It's summing cards where power is '*' OR NULL, but the question only asks for unknown power (which is typically NULL). 2) The hasFoil condition might be oversimplified - we should check if the card exists in foil version. 3) The duelDeck comparison should likely be case-insensitive."
