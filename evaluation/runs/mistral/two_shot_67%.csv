651,False,simple,True,"The query returned the related post title, but it seems not to match the original question.

A more accurate query would be: SELECT AVG(T1.crimes_committed) FROM district AS T1 INNER JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id INNER JOIN crimes AS T3 ON T1.region_id = T3.region_id WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', T2.date) >= '1997' AND T3.year = 1995 AND T1.A15 > 4000"
