479,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly answers the question. It identifies cards from the Coldsnap set with converted mana cost greater than 5 and counts those with unknown power (represented by '*' or NULL). The query uses appropriate joins between the cards and sets tables, and correctly filters for the Coldsnap set. The CASE statement properly handles both NULL values and '*' which typically represents unknown power in card games."
1057,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly calculates the average home team goals for matches in Poland during the 2010/2011 season. It performs the following operations correctly:
1. Joins the Country and Match tables to filter by country
2. Filters for Poland and the 2010/2011 season
3. Calculates the average by dividing the sum of home team goals by the count of matches
4. Returns a single value representing the average"
1367,False,simple,True,"The query has two main issues: 1. It's grouping by major_id but selecting college, which could lead to incorrect aggregation. 2. Since we want to find the college with the most members, we should group by college, not major_id. Also, the COUNT() should be displayed in the results to verify the numbers."
298,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly calculates the percentage of carcinogenic molecules containing hydrogen. It: 1) Joins the atom and molecule tables to link elements with molecules, 2) Filters for hydrogen atoms ('h') and carcinogenic compounds (label = '+'), 3) Uses COUNT and CAST to calculate the percentage accurately. The result of ~17.22% appears reasonable for this type of analysis."

It properly joins the League and Match tables, filters for the correct season, groups by league name, counts the matches, and orders them in descending order to get the top 4. The query structure and logic are sound."
1165,False,moderate,True,"The query has two main issues: 1) It's looking for patients with TG >= 200, which represents high triglycerides, not normal levels. Normal triglyceride levels are typically below 150 mg/dL. 2) The query calculates the age difference using only years, which might not be precise enough as it ignores months and days."
494,False,challenging,True,"The query has several issues:
1. While it retrieves rulings for cards illustrated by Jim Pavelec, it doesn't address whether these cards have missing or degraded properties.
2. To check for missing or degraded properties, we should examine null values or potentially problematic values in various card attributes.
3. The current query only shows the ruling text and content warnings, which doesn't fully answer the question about missing/degraded properties.
4. We should include relevant card properties in the output to properly assess their completeness."
1126,False,simple,True,"The current query has several issues: 1) It only looks at home_player_1 position, ignoring other player positions and away team players. 2) It joins through Match table which isn't necessary and might cause duplicates. 3) Players should be directly linked to their nationality/country rather than through matches. 4) Some players in the results (like Boubacar Barry Copa from Ivory Coast) are clearly not from Belgium, indicating the logic is incorrect."
1292,False,challenging,True,"There are several issues with the query: 1. The condition T2.UA > 6.5 looks for values above the normal range, not within it. Typically, the normal range for uric acid is between 2.4-6.0 mg/dL for females. 2. We should use BETWEEN or appropriate comparison operators to check for values within the normal range. 3. The query structure otherwise correctly joins the necessary tables and selects the anti Cardiolipin antibody values."

1133,False,simple,True,"The query has two issues: 1) The comparison for the 1990s should be '1990-01-01' to include all players born in the 1990s, and 2) The LIKE condition should check for 'Aaron' anywhere in the name, not just at the start, as it could be a middle name or part of a longer first name. Also, we should ensure we're checking the first name specifically."
535,True,simple,True,"The query correctly addresses the original question. It: 1) Filters users with more than 100 upvotes (Upvotes > 100), 2) Further filters those users to only include ones with more than 1 downvote (Downvotes > 1), and 3) Counts the resulting number of users.

1102,False,moderate,True,"The query is incorrect because it orders by birthday ASC (ascending), which will give us the youngest player, not the oldest player. To find the oldest player, we should order by birthday DESC (descending). Additionally, it's good practice to ensure we're only considering players with valid ratings by adding a check for non-null overall_rating."

1300,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly identifies the disease name (Diagnosis) of the patient with the highest triglyceride (TG) level while staying within the normal range (<200). It joins the Examination table (containing diagnoses) with the Laboratory table (containing TG levels), filters for normal TG values (<200), orders by TG in descending order, and takes the first result. This matches the requirements of the original question."
1120,False,moderate,True,"The current query has several issues: 1) It only checks for players in the away_player_5 position, but players could have played in other positions (away_player_1 through away_player_11). 2) The query needs to count goals when either player was on the away team, regardless of their position. 3) The current approach might miss games where these players scored but were in different positions."

The results show four categories (Parking, Speaker Gifts, Advertisement, and Food) with their respective budgeted amounts in ascending order."
883,False,simple,True,"The query partially answers the question. While it correctly lists all races in 2005 in descending order by name, it doesn't explicitly show the count of races as requested in the first part of the question ('How many races were there in 2005?'). The query should include a count of the races along with the list."
789,True,simple,True,The query correctly calculates the average weight of heroes who are aliens. It joins the superhero and race tables to filter aliens and then calculates the average weight using SUM/COUNT. The CAST AS REAL ensures decimal precision in the calculation. The query structure and logic are sound.
347,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues:
1. The artist name in the WHERE clause is 'Stephen Daniele' but the question asks for 'Stephen Daniel' - this is a misspelling.
2. The query shows rulings but doesn't explicitly tell us which cards these rulings belong to (the card names are missing in the selection).
3. While the query shows hasContentWarning (0 values), it doesn't comprehensively show missing or degraded properties as requested in the question.
4. The results would be more useful if they included the card names alongside their rulings."
1211,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues:
1. The range calculation is incorrect - the question asks for LDH between 100-300 index above normal range, but the query uses absolute values (600-800)
2. We need to know the normal range reference value to calculate the correct range
3. Assuming normal LDH range is typically 300-500, the query should look for values between (normal upper limit + 100) and (normal upper limit + 300)
4. Using 500 as upper normal limit, we should search for LDH between 600-800
5. The current query uses these values but without proper medical context verification"
1115,True,challenging,True,"The query correctly calculates the percentage difference between Landon Donovan's and Jordan Bowery's overall ratings on the specified date (2013/7/12). The query uses appropriate joins between Player and Player_Attributes tables, filters for the correct date, and calculates the percentage difference using the formula ((Donovan - Bowery) / Donovan) * 100. The result shows that Donovan's rating was approximately 25.32% higher than Bowery's on that date."
1045,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the attacking work rate for the player Franco Zennaro by joining the Player and Player_Attributes tables using player_api_id and filtering for the specific player name. The result shows that Franco Zennaro has a 'medium' attacking work rate. The DISTINCT keyword is used appropriately to avoid duplicate values if there are multiple records for the same player.
227,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) The table alias 'T' is inconsistent - it's defined as lowercase 't' but used as uppercase 'T' in the SELECT statement. 2) The table name should be 'molecule' (as shown) not 'T'. 3) The query assumes '+' represents carcinogenic molecules, but this should be verified with the database schema. 4) The query formatting could be improved for better readability."
1379,True,simple,True,The query correctly answers the question by counting the number of meeting events in 2020.

717,True,simple,True,"The query is correct and efficiently answers the question. It joins the necessary tables (superhero, hero_power, and superpower) to retrieve the power names associated with 3-D Man. The query uses appropriate JOIN conditions and filters for the specific superhero. The result provides a clear list of 3-D Man's superpowers: Agility, Super Strength, Stamina, and Super Speed."
1495,False,simple,True,"While the query attempts to find the client with highest consumption, there are a few issues: 1. The JOIN condition is correct but the query doesn't properly show the consumption amount. 2. It would be more informative to show both the CustomerID and their consumption value. 3. The date filtering is correct for September 2013."
1131,False,simple,True,The query has several issues: 1. It's joining Player with Match table which is incorrect and may lead to duplicate players if they played multiple matches. 2. The join relationship between Match and Country tables seems incorrect as country_id in Match might not represent the player's nationality. 3. We should directly join Player with Country table using the player's nationality/country_id. 4. The CAST is unnecessary since division automatically converts to floating point.
1124,False,moderate,True,"The query attempts to find players with high attacking work rate, but there are several issues: 1. The original question asks about players who tend to attack when their teammates are attacking, which implies a more complex relationship than just high attacking work rate. 2. The question suggests we need to analyze players' behavior in relation to their teammates' movements, which might require joining with match events or player positioning data. 3. The current query only looks at individual attacking_work_rate attribute without considering teammate interactions."
692,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It doesn't specify which badge we're looking for. 2) The date difference is calculated but the unit (days/months/years) is not clear. 3) If the user has multiple badges, the query might return multiple rows without any aggregation. 4) The query needs to be more specific about which badge's timing we're interested in."

938,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1. It's not correctly identifying the champion/winner. The condition 'T2.time LIKE '_:%:__.___'' is not the right way to find the winner. We should use position = 1 or check for the winner status. 2. The Australian Grand Prix might not be the determining race for the championship. The champion is determined by total points across the season. 3. If we're looking for the race winner (not champion), we should explicitly filter for position = 1."
1357,True,simple,True,"The query correctly answers the question by showing the dates when Connor Hilton paid their dues. The query properly joins the member and income tables, filters by the member's name, and ensures the income source is 'Dues'.

1458,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1. It's calculating the difference between absolute counts rather than individual percentages. 2. The percentage calculation is incorrect as it's dividing by the total count of all members, not calculating separate percentages for each state first. 3. To find the difference in percentages, we should first calculate the percentage for each state separately and then find the difference."
784,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the full names of vampire heroes by joining the superhero table with the race table and filtering for vampires. The result shows Liam and Eric Brooks (who is known as Blade), both of whom are vampire heroes.

342,False,simple,True,The query has several issues: 1) It only returns a single card name (LIMIT 1) when the question asks for a list of cards. 2) The question mentions 'value' but this isn't considered in the query. 3) The ORDER BY clause isn't sufficient to compare cost vs value ratio. 4) There's no comparison being made between value and mana cost as requested in the question.
204,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1. The BETWEEN clause with string literals 'TR000' AND 'TR099' may not correctly capture the first 100 molecules, as string comparison works differently than numerical comparison. 2.

458,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues:
1. The LIKE condition with '%arena,mtgo%' is not reliable as it assumes the availability values are stored in a specific format and order.
2. We need to ensure both 'arena' and 'mtgo' exist in availability independently.

The GROUP BY clause is unnecessary since we're not performing any aggregation. 3. The query only lists the IDs but doesn't provide the count that was asked for. A better query should both COUNT the total number and list the card IDs.
892,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly identifies Sebastian Vettel as the driver with the most points (397.0) by joining the races, driverStandings, and drivers tables. It returns his full name (forename and surname) along with his points as requested. The ORDER BY clause ensures we get the highest points, and LIMIT 1 gives us the single top result. The joins are properly constructed to connect driver information with their standings."
748,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves the eye color for the superhero with ID 75. It properly joins the superhero table with the colour table using the eye_colour_id foreign key and filters for the specific superhero ID. The query is well-structured and returns the expected result.
192,False,moderate,True,"The query has several issues: 1. The interpretation of 'running contract' is not correct - status 'C' and 'D' might not represent running contracts. We should verify the correct status codes for running loans. 2. The condition for 'statement issuance after each transaction' is attempted to be captured with 'frequency = POPLATEK PO OBRATU', but this might not be the correct interpretation. 3. The query needs to better clarify what constitutes a 'running contract' and how it relates to statement issuance timing. 4. The result format shows a single average without context about the time period or other relevant details."
678,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the post with the highest view count authored by Harvey Motulsky. It performs an inner join between users and posts tables, filters for posts by Harvey Motulsky, orders by view count in descending order, and limits to 1 result to get the most viewed post. The query returns both the ID (109) and the title of the post as requested in the original question."
1224,True,simple,True,"The query correctly answers the original question. It finds the patient with the highest total bilirubin (T-BIL) level and includes all requested information:
1. Highest T-BIL value (7.9)
2. Patient ID (2931207)
3. Sex (F)
4. Birthday (1959-01-05)

The query uses appropriate joins between the Patient and Laboratory tables and orders by T-BIL in descending order with a LIMIT 1 to get the highest value."
1177,True,simple,True,"The query correctly determines whether the patient's total cholesterol status was normal on the specified date. It checks if the T-CHO value is less than 250 (which is a standard threshold for normal cholesterol levels) and returns 'Normal' or 'Abnormal' accordingly. The result shows 'Normal', directly answering the original question. The patient ID and date filtering are correctly implemented."
31,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly calculates the free meal rate for the 10th and 11th schools by: 1) Ordering schools by enrollment in descending order, 2) Using LIMIT 9,2 to skip the first 9 records and return the next 2 records, and 3) Calculating the free meal rate by dividing free meal count by total enrollment. The result shows the free meal rates as decimals (approximately 13.4% and 29.1%) for these two schools."
512,False,simple,True,"The query has multiple issues: 1) It's only checking for power = '*' or NULL, but 'unknown power' might have other representations. 2) The hasFoil condition might be incorrectly filtering cards that 'can't be found in foil' as it's looking for cards where hasFoil = 0. This assumes the data is stored this way, which might not be accurate. 3) The duelDeck comparison is case-sensitive, which might miss cards if the deck names are stored with different cases."
202,True,simple,True,"The query correctly identifies the number of triple bonds in the database by counting bonds where the bond_type is '#' (which represents triple bonds in chemical notation). The query returns 6 triple bonds, which directly answers the original question. The approach of using COUNT() on bond_id where bond_type = '#' is appropriate for this question."
1226,False,simple,True,"The query has several issues: 1) It orders by Birthday ASC which would give the youngest patient, not the oldest. 2) The ORDER BY clause should prioritize age first, then T-CHO, as we want the oldest patient among those with the highest cholesterol. 3) Birthday ASC means newer dates (younger patients) come first, so it should be DESC for oldest first."
893,True,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the top 3 drivers and their points from the 2017 Chinese Grand Prix. It joins the necessary tables (races, driverStandings, and drivers) to get the driver names and points. The results show Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton tied for the lead with 43 points each, followed by Max Verstappen with 25 points. The ordering and limiting are correctly implemented."
579,True,simple,True,The query correctly retrieves all comments made on the specified post. It uses an appropriate JOIN between the comments and posts tables and filters based on the exact post title. The query structure and results accurately answer the original question by showing all comments associated with the post about gentle boosting vs AdaBoost.
879,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly answers the question. It joins the drivers and results tables to find the driver with the highest fastestLapSpeed and returns their nationality. The query uses appropriate JOIN conditions, ordering, and limiting to get the single result needed. The returned Italian nationality represents the driver who set the fastest lap speed in the database."
948,True,simple,True,"The query correctly identifies the maximum points scored by British constructors. It joins the constructorStandings table with the constructors table to filter for British nationality and then finds the maximum points. The query uses appropriate tables and joins, and the WHERE clause correctly filters for British constructors."
