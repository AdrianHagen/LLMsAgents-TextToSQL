479,False,moderate,True,"The query seems to count the number of cards with unknown power among those that have a converted mana cost greater than 5 in the Coldsnap set. However, it should return the count of such cards instead of summing up the number of occurrences. Also, since there might be multiple cards meeting the criteria, the aggregation function SUM is not appropriate here."

A join with the 'crime' table is missing, and the necessary conditions should be added."
1254,False,moderate,True,"The query is partially correct. However, it only filters for Ig A levels between 80 and 500 but does not specify that the level should be 'normal'. Also, the question asks about patients who came to the hospital after 1990/1/1, but the query checks if the first date is greater than 1990 without considering the month and day. To improve the query, you can add a condition for normal Ig A levels and filter for dates after 1990-01-01. Here's an example: SELECT COUNT(T1.ID) FROM Patient AS T1 INNER JOIN Laboratory AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.IGA BETWEEN 80 AND 500 AND T2.IgA_level = 'Normal' AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', T1.`First Date`) > '1990-01-01';"

Also, make sure to join the appropriate table that contains the total number of test takers (if not already included in satscores)."
34,False,moderate,True,"The query is almost correct but it seems that the filter for age range and student type (free meals) is not applied properly.

However, the query does not filter the results by the client's information or loan amount application date. To improve the query, you should join the appropriate table that contains the client's birth_date and also filter by the loan application details."
686,False,simple,True,"The query result does not answer the question correctly. The provided SQL query returns post Id's but it doesn't filter posts with views above average.
