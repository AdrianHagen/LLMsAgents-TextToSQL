89,True,moderate,True,"The query correctly identifies the number of accounts who choose issuance after transaction. However, it might be more readable if the table alias is used consistently (either T1 and T2 or district and account) throughout the query."
90,True,simple,True,The query is correct and accurately answers the question.
91,False,simple,True,"The query provides the year with the highest average unemployment ratio, but it doesn't compare the ratios between 1995 and 1996 to determine which year has a higher percentage. To improve the query, we should extract the averages for each year separately and then compare them."
92,True,simple,True,"The query is correct and it correctly answers the question. However, for better readability, consider using an alias for the subquery in the FROM clause."
93,True,moderate,True,The query is accurate in terms of structure and logic. It correctly filters for male customers living in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000.
94,False,challenging,True,"The query does not correctly answer the question as it lists the account number of the oldest female client with the lowest average salary but doesn't calculate the gap between the lowest and highest average salaries for all female clients. 
To improve this query, first, you need to find the lowest average salary for all female clients using a subquery, then find the highest average salary for all female clients, and finally, calculate the difference.
Here is a revised query:"
95,False,moderate,True,"The query is not entirely correct. The question asks for the account numbers of clients who are youngest and have the highest average salary. However, the provided SQL query only seems to be filtering by the district and does not include the condition for the youngest client or the calculation for the average salary in the GROUP BY clause. To improve this query, it would be better to use a subquery to first find the youngest client, then join with the financial data, and finally order and group by the account ID."
96,True,simple,True,The query is accurate and correctly answers the original question.
97,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be filtering for clients who have a frequency of 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' and a type of 'DISPONENT', but it does not appear to filter for clients whose transactions are 'Disponent'. Additionally, the question asks for the id number of clients who chose 'statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent', but the query does not seem to be looking for this specific criterion."
98,False,moderate,True,"The query is not completely accurate as it does not return the lowest approved amount for accounts with a loan date in 1997 and selected weekly issuance statement. It only returns the account ID of an account with a loan date in 1997, but without assurance that it has the lowest approved amount or weekly issuance statement.
To improve the query, consider adding an ORDER BY clause to sort by the approved amount and limit the result to the topmost record.
Also, it would be beneficial to include the approved amount in the SELECT clause for more meaningful results."
99,False,moderate,True,"The query is partially correct. It returns the account_id of an account opened in 1993 with a loan duration more than 12 months, but it does not filter by the highest approved amount among those accounts. To answer the original question, you should also include the condition 'AND T1.amount = (SELECT MAX(amount) FROM loan AS T3 WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', T3.date) = '1993' AND T3.duration > 12)' to get the account with the highest approved amount."
