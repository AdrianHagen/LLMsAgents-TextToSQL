1367,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be returning the college with the most members in the 'major' table. However, it does not account for the membership of each college across all clubs in the 'student_club' table. To accurately answer the question, you should join the 'member' and 'student_club' tables and group by the college to count the number of members from each college in total."
298,False,moderate,True,"The query does not directly answer the question about the percentage of molecules containing carcinogenic compounds that have hydrogen as an element. The query seems to be calculating the ratio of molecules containing at least one hydrogen atom (element 'h') to the total number of molecules, but it does not take into account the label (+) which indicates the presence of a carcinogenic compound. To improve the query, you could join the 'atom' and 'molecule' tables on 'molecule_id', then filter for carcinogenic compounds (label '+') and hydrogen atoms (element 'h'), and finally calculate the percentage based on this filtered dataset."
651,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be returning the title of a related post instead of the original question's exact title. To improve, you could modify the WHERE clause to search for titles containing specific keywords from the original question."
1145,True,simple,True,"The query is accurate and correctly answers the original question. It filters by the specified season (2015/2016) and orders the leagues based on the count of matches in descending order, returning the top 4."

1126,True,simple,True,The query is correctly structured to answer the question. It filters the players based on their country of origin (Belgium).
1292,False,challenging,True,"The query correctly selects the aCL IgG, aCL IgM, and aCL IgA values but does not filter for the patient with the highest uric acid level within the normal range. To answer the original question, you should add an additional condition to the WHERE clause that filters for patients where their UA value is in the normal range (typically below 7.0) and has the maximum uric acid level."
9,True,simple,True,The query is correct and answers the question accurately.
152,False,moderate,True,The query is not correct as it does not filter the year for crimes committed and it's aggregating the sum instead of average. The join condition with account table should also be related to the crime data. Here's a suggestion for an updated query:
1254,False,moderate,True,"The query is close to answering the question but it requires some adjustments. The current query includes all patients and checks if their IgA level is between 80 and 500, but it does not filter for normal IgA levels or those who came after 1990/1/1. To improve the query, you can add conditions to filter for normal IgA levels and dates later than '1990-01-01'."
609,True,simple,True,The query is correct and accurately answers the original question. It correctly retrieves the count of posts with a score of 10.
823,False,moderate,True,"The query appears to be correct in terms of structure, but it might not accurately answer the question as it is filtering by both publisher and gender. To get the count of female superheroes specifically from Marvel Comics, we should only filter by gender (Female) and then check if the corresponding publisher_name is 'Marvel Comics'."

1154,False,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieved the sex and birthday of patient ID '163109'. However, it did not provide the examination date and symptom as requested in the original question. The missing fields can be added to the SELECT clause."
54,False,simple,True,"The query is not entirely correct as it only returns one school under Avetik Atoian's administration. To answer the original question, the query should be modified to include all schools under his administration. Consider using a JOIN statement if multiple tables are involved."
53,False,simple,True,"The query returns the number of test takers per school in Fresno. However, the original question asks for the total number of test takers at schools with a mailing city address in Fresno. To answer this question, you should aggregate the results to get the total count of test takers and not just list the schools and their corresponding counts."
34,False,moderate,True,"The query is not answering the question correctly. The issue lies in filtering the data for students between ages 5 and 17, as well as identifying the correct field that represents the free rate for these students. It seems like the query is calculating the free meal count per enrollment which might not be the same as the free rate.
To improve the query, consider filtering for the appropriate age group (e.g., using a 'WHERE' clause to specify ages 5-17) and finding the relevant field representing the free rate for these students."
904,False,moderate,True,"The query correctly selects the race and year for Michael Schumacher, but it should filter the results to find his fastest lap. To do this, you need to include the 'milliseconds' column in the ORDER BY clause and adjust the LIMIT clause accordingly."
542,True,simple,True,The query is accurate and correctly answers the question about the total number of comments on all posts owned by csgillespie.
1341,False,simple,True,"The query is not completely correct. The issue lies in the database being used. It seems that this query was generated for the 'event' table in the 'student_club' database, but the original question asks for the location of an event named 'Spring Budget Review'. It would be more appropriate to join this with the 'venue' table if it exists and has a connection to the 'event' table through an 'id' or 'event_id'."
279,False,simple,True,"The query is not returning the expected result because it is missing a clause to filter by the specific row for bond ID TR001_10_11. To improve the query, add a WHERE clause that filters based on the primary key or unique index of the 'bond' table."
491,True,simple,True,"The query is accurate and correctly answers the question. However, for better readability, consider adding a clause to select only the first element from the result set in case there are multiple matching rows."
1314,False,simple,True,"The query is almost correct but it only returns the first name and last name of a member. To answer the original question, you should include the full names (concatenated first name and last name) for the students that come from the Art and Design Department."
1161,False,challenging,True,"The query is almost correct but it should filter the data for in-patients aged 50 and above, and also filter for anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) specifically. The current query is averaging all values in the 'aCL IgG' column without any specific condition."

841,True,simple,True,The query is accurate and correctly provides the weight (63) and race ('Human') of superhero with ID 40.
1102,False,moderate,True,"The query is almost correct but it needs to order the results by birthday in descending order to find the oldest player. Additionally, it should filter for players with a birthdate before 2016-06-23 because the question asks for players who were older on that specific date."
847,True,simple,True,"The query correctly answers the question by returning the surname of the driver with the best lap time in race number 19. However, it would be more informative to also include the lap time for context."
1300,False,moderate,True,"The query is not correct because it returns the diagnosis of the patient with the highest triglyceride value, not necessarily within the normal range. To find the disease name for a patient whose triglycerides are in the normal range (<150), you need to first filter the results based on this condition before ordering and selecting the diagnosis."
1120,False,moderate,True,"The query is almost correct, but it does not aggregate the goal scores for both Daan Smith and Filipe Ferreira. To correctly answer the question, the query should sum up the individual goal scores for each player and then combine them. Here's an updated SQL query:"

920,True,simple,True,The query is accurate. It correctly retrieves the years that Silverstone Circuit was used in a Formula_1 race.
648,False,simple,True,"The query is incorrect because it only returns the user's display name and website URL who owns a post with favorite count more than 150, but the question asks for posts. To correct this, you should join the posts table to get the required information."
113,False,simple,True,"The query does not return the birthday of the client who applied for a loan of 98832 USD in 1996/1/3. The query is filtering by date and amount but it seems that there might be missing condition for the specific client's ID. Also, ensure to include the 'AS' keyword after the table aliases for better readability."
686,False,simple,True,"The query is not accurate as it returns the Id of posts with views greater than average instead of the total number of such posts. To improve the query, you should count the number of rows that satisfy the condition instead of selecting their Ids. Here's a suggestion for an updated query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE ViewCount > (SELECT AVG(ViewCount) FROM posts)."
1405,False,moderate,True,"The query correctly returns the categories budgeted for the 'April Speaker' event in ascending order based on their amount budgeted. However, it does not filter the results to show only the budgeted amount for this specific event and does not provide the total budgeted amount for the 'April Speaker' event."
883,False,simple,True,"The query is almost correct but it should count the number of races and display them in descending order. The current result contains all the races from 2005, but not their count."
789,False,simple,True,"The query correctly filters the data for heroes who are aliens, but it calculates only the sum of their weights instead of finding the average. To correct this issue, you should divide the total weight by the count of alien heroes. Here's an updated query: 'SELECT CAST(SUM(T1.weight_kg) AS REAL) / COUNT(T1.id) FROM superhero AS T1 INNER JOIN race AS T2 ON T1.race_id = T2.id WHERE T2.race = 'Alien' GROUP BY T1.id'."
347,False,moderate,False,LLM Failure
1211,False,moderate,True,"The query is providing the ID and age of all patients with LDH values between 600 and 800, but the original question asks for patients whose LDH is above the normal range. The normal range for LDH is typically less than 600 U/L (units per liter). Also, it seems there are no filters to consider if the patient is a patient or not, and no field for LDH in the result."
1115,False,challenging,False,LLM Failure
1045,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be filtering correctly for the player Franco Zennaro but it only returns the attacking work rate attribute. To answer the question about the attacking work rate of Franco Zennaro accurately, you should return a numeric value that represents his attacking work rate. You can modify the query by adding the appropriate aggregation function (e.g., AVG) to the SELECT clause and removing the DISTINCT keyword."
227,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be calculating the proportion of all molecules that are not carcinogenic (since it is calculating the count where the label is not '+'). To correct this, we should calculate the proportion of molecules that are carcinogenic instead. Also, consider adding an alias for the calculated value for better readability."

1131,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be calculating the sum of heights and dividing by the count of player ids instead of calculating the average height for Italy players. To fix this issue, you can group by the player's nationality (Country) and calculate the average height only for Italy (WHERE T3.NAME = 'Italy')."
1124,False,moderate,True,"The query correctly filters the players based on high attacking work rate, however it does not answer the original question which asks for players that tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves. It seems that there is no attribute or relationship in the provided database schema to determine this information."
692,False,moderate,True,"The query seems to be almost correct, but it's not providing the time duration as requested in the original question. To get the time difference, you should subtract the 'CreationDate' from the corresponding 'Date' column, and the result should be a datetime or float (number of days)."

1357,False,simple,True,"The query is almost correct, but it should return a single date instead of multiple dates if the student has paid his dues only once. To find the exact date Connor Hilton paid his dues, use a subquery to ensure that the source is 'Dues' and that there are no unpaid amounts for the same member_id and year. Additionally, it would be beneficial to order the dates in descending order to get the most recent payment date."
477,False,challenging,True,"The query correctly identifies Chippy as an artist in the 'Coldsnap' set. However, it fails to answer the original question by not returning Jeremy Jarvis, who is also known to have designed a card in the 'Coldsnap' set. To improve the query, you should use a 'OR' clause to combine conditions for all artists instead of separate 'OR' clauses for each artist."

1458,True,moderate,True,No changes needed. The query is accurate.

342,False,simple,True,"The query result does not correctly answer the question. The original question asks for card names with a value that costs more converted mana for the face. However, the generated SQL query only retrieves the first record sorted by faceConvertedManaCost without considering the cost condition. To answer the question accurately, we need to retrieve cards with a higher converted mana cost for their face."
204,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be correct in structure and filtering the molecules between a specific range. However, it is missing the sorting clause to ensure that the molecules are ordered by their number. Additionally, the label '+' does not correspond to carcinogenic molecules. The label should be either '+' for non-carcinogens or '-' for carcinogens."
458,False,simple,True,"The query is incorrect as it counts the number of cards with availability containing 'arena,mtgo' and black borderColor instead of checking for exact matching of both conditions. The correct SQL query should use AND operator instead of OR (as it stands now, a card that meets either condition will be counted). Suggested updated query is given below."

295,False,simple,True,"The query correctly retrieves the count of atoms that belong to molecules labeled with a '+' and are hydrogen (h), but it doesn't filter by carcinogenic compounds.

776,False,simple,True,"The query seems to be correct in terms of structure and filtering the data based on the given name. However, it does not provide the race of Charles Chandler. To improve the accuracy of the query, you should join the 'superhero' table with the 'character' table where 'superhero_id' matches the corresponding id in the 'character' table, and then filter by 'full_name'. Also, it would be best to get both hero name and race in one row for easier comprehension."
817,False,moderate,True,"The query returns the race for blue-haired male superheroes, but it does not filter results based on the hair color of the superhero. To answer the original question correctly, you should add a condition to filter by the hair color of the superhero. Also, since the original question asks for a specific character (the blue-haired male superhero), consider adding an aggregation function like MAX or MIN to return only one result."
353,False,simple,True,"The query is partially correct in that it retrieves sets with Italian translations. However, it does not provide any additional information about the card languages which are required to answer the original question fully. To do so, you should join the sets table with another table containing card language information and filter for Italian. You may also want to select the set names along with their corresponding totalSetSize values."
1062,False,moderate,True,"The query is almost correct but it seems to be missing the condition that restricts the date range for the overall rating. Also, it should group by player and sum up the ratings. Here's an example of how to fix the issue: SELECT DISTINCT t1.player_name FROM Player AS t1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS t2 ON t1.player_api_id = t2.player_api_id WHERE t2.overall_rating > 80 AND SUBSTR(t2.`date`, 1, 4) BETWEEN '2008' AND '2010' GROUP BY t1.player_name HAVING SUM(t2.overall_rating) >= 240"

The 'bond_type' column in the provided SQL query does not seem relevant."
